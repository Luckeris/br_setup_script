This repository contains a setup script for the ESP Thread Border Router/Zigbee Gateway V1.2 and ESP32C6 CLI, for a homemade thread dongle for homeassistant.
It is mainly for study reasons, so nothing granted.
We are currently trying to improve this script, maybe make it a executable in the close future.
Keep in mind, we are just people and in addition newbies and students, so if there is something wrong or not working, Let us know!
